                <h2 style="margin-top: 0px;">Why I made car axle client</h2>
                <p style="font-size: 1.4vw;">The story of car axle client is very simple. One day, in the middle of summer, I was bored. I wanted to do something, and so, I did something. And if you didn't already know what I did, I started development of the first version of car axle client. It was orginally going to a have a megahack like UI, but I decided to restart the project. This restart moved away from basic javascript and into the world of typescript and webpack. A few months later car axle client was finished andthe first version was realeased. If you were wondering why I typed this, I only did it because I need to get my adverts going so I need more content on the website.</p>
